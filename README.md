<h5> The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a centralised location for all my lab work and learning materials throughout the course. It acts as both a personal learning hub and a version-controlled workspace where I can store, organize, and track my progress over time. By using GitHub, I aim to gain hands-on experience with essential tools used in the software development and data science industries. This repository not only helps me maintain a clean and structured workflow, but also allows me to revisit and review past exercises, experiments, and projects as I continue learning. </h5>

*goals for the course* 
<ol>
  <li>Learn GitHub Basics:
I want to develop a solid understanding of GitHub, including how to create repositories, clone projects, commit changes, push updates, and collaborate using branches and pull requests. These skills are fundamental for working on real-world software and data science projects, especially in team environments.</li>
  <li>Gain a Deeper Understanding of AI:
One of my major goals is to explore the core principles of artificial intelligence. I aim to learn how AI systems are built, trained, and evaluated, and to get hands-on experience with tools and frameworks used in machine learning and AI development.i</li>
  <li>Improve Code Literacy and Confidence:
I hope to strengthen my ability to read, understand, and analyse code written by others. By working through exercises and studying different coding styles, I want to become more comfortable navigating unfamiliar codebases and identifying how different parts of a program work together.</li>
  <li>Develop Practical, Future-Ready Skills:
This course is an opportunity to build technical skills that will benefit me in future academic or professional settings. Whether itâ€™s programming in Python, using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or Scikit-Learn, or applying data analysis and visualisation techniques, I want to come away from this course with practical knowledge that I can apply in real-world scenarios.</li>

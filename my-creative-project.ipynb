    "Mythos Machine is a proposed digital platform that allows users to co-create interactive mythological stories with help from large language models (LLM). The system combines AI-generated narratives with user decisions to build branching tales rooted in global folklore, legends, and cultural traditions. This creative storytelling tool is designed to preserve and reimagine ancient myths while offering a deeply personalised and educational experience. Users can explore a blend of traditional narrative structures and generative creativity - where they are both the reader and the co-author., where they are both the reader and the co-author."

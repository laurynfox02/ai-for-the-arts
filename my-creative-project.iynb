# Project Title: *Mythos Machine*
### An Interactive Storytelling Platform Powered by Large Language Models

---

## Project Overview

*Mythos Machine* is a proposed digital platform that allows users to co-create interactive mythology-inspired stories with the help of a large language model (LLM). The system combines AI-generated narratives with user decisions to build branching tales rooted in global folklore, legends, and cultural traditions.

This creative storytelling tool is designed to preserve and reimagine ancient myths while offering a deeply personalized and educational experience. Users can explore a blend of traditional narrative structures and generative creativity—where they are both the reader and the co-author.
